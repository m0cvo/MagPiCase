#MagPiCase

### A 3D printable case for the Raspberry Pi Zero

####Original

This is the basic case shown in the legendary issue 40 (the one that had a free Pi Zero on the cover). This is a slim case for a Pi Zero without a header. It requires screws to hold everything together. 

####V2

An updated version. This one has an opening to accommodate a header and is slightly thicker as it includes a recess for the soldered pins at the bottom.

The Pi Zero sits on four pins which are used to hold on the lid. 

There are two versions of the lid: one with MagPi branding and one with \#PiZero text.
